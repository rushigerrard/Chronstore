This project is divided in 3 sub modules
1. Chord module
2. Object Store module
3. Client module

We provide a set of scripts which will allow you to deploy this complete system on multiple docker
containers and then test it. This script currently only works for Ubuntu based systems. 
Let us assume that we want to setup this system on a machine with IP 192.168.0.100, and we already
have ssh access to this machine via user 'tester'.
(To setup everything on current machine just replace the IP with localhost).
